How to use GitHub:

1. Follow the instructions here if you do not have an account, through connecting GitHub to RStudio (as needed):  
https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html  
2. Follow the instructions (at least through 5) here under "How to do this using RStudio and GitHub?" https://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/  
  a. you don't need to enter the backticks in the shell  
  b. this example is a bit misleading because it doesn't include the .git, copy the link to the clipboard like before  
  c. RESTART RSTUDIO BEFORE MOVING ONTO STEP 6 IN THIS TUTORIAL  
3. "example.R" shows you example implementations of the functions (also read comments, functions that produce files are commented out)  
4. If you want to pull updates from here to your copy, see chapter 31: https://happygitwithr.com/upstream-changes.html#pull-changes-from-upstream

Ideas for R package functions:  
load_data()  
export_data()  
summarize_health_data()  
node_plots()  
export_node_plots()  
node_channel_plots()  
export_node_channel_plots()
